## Project structure

We can divide the project structure into layers:

* **1st Layer: Project layer.** Where all the tools live to make our live easier.
* **2nd Layer: App layer.** The place where we add code. This includes our custom Flet app and other Flet tools like the icon-browser.


### Project layer
```
your_app_project/
├── flet
│   ├── app/
│   ├── tools/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── .copier-answers
├── .gitignore
├── docker-compose-devel-tools.yaml
├── docker-compose-devel.yaml
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

We can organize all these files by technology:

* Copier:
    * `.copier-answers`: The place where we save the answers of a fletflow Copier project.
* Make:
    * `Makefile`: This file adds a collection of scripts to automate some tasks.
* Docker:
    * `Dockerfile`: Docker recipe for the Flet service.
    * `docker-compose-devel.yaml`: Docker Compose base file for the development environment.
    * `docker-compose.yaml`: symlink to the `-devel` file autogenerated using the Makefile tasks.
    * `docker-compose-tools.yaml`: the place where the extra tools are described and able to run.
* Other:
    * `README.md`: Your project's Read-me file.
    * `LICENSE`: Your project's License.
    * `.gitignore`: Files that shouldn't be added with Git.
